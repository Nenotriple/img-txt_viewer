## Tagger Shortcuts

- **ALT + LEFT/RIGHT:** Quickly move between img-txt pairs.
- **SHIFT + DEL:** Move the current pair to a local trash folder.
- **ALT:** Cycle through autocomplete suggestions.
- **TAB:** Insert the highlighted suggestion.
- **CTRL + S:** Save the current text file.
- **CTRL + E:** Jump to the next empty text file.
- **CTRL + R:** Jump to a random img-txt pair.
- **CTRL + F:** Open Find and Replace.
- **CTRL + Z / CTRL + Y:** Undo / Redo.

# Tag-Editor Help

## Overview
Batch Tag Edit lets you view, filter, edit, and delete tags across all text files in your working directory. All changes are staged as *pending* until you **commit** them.

## Technical Notes
- Designed for CSV-like text files. Both commas and periods are treated as tag or caption delimiters.
- Some special characters or formatting may not be handled as expected.
- *Always back up your text files before committing changes.*

## Instructions
1. Use the filter controls to narrow the tag list.
    - *Filter by tag text* or by *tag count* (see Filter Tips).
    - Filtering is disabled while there are pending changes.
2. Select tags to edit or delete (Ctrl+Click or Shift+Click for multi select).
3. To edit: enter a new tag in the Edit box and click **Apply** (or press Enter).
    - To delete: leave the Edit box empty and click **Apply**, or use the right-click menu.
    - Right-click a tag for **Edit / Delete / Copy** and quick actions.
4. Pending changes appear in the *Action* and *New Tag* columns and are highlighted (green = edit, red = delete).
5. Click **Commit Changes** to apply all pending edits and deletes to the text files. This cannot be undone.
6. Use **Refresh** to reload the tag list and clear pending changes and filters.

## Filter Tips
- Filter options:
    - *Contains Text*: show tags containing the input text.
    - *Does Not Contain*: exclude tags containing the input text.
    - *Count Equals / Not Equals*: filter tags by exact count.
    - *Count Less Than / Greater Than*: filter tags by count range.
- For most options you can enter multiple values separated by commas.
- Example: to show tags used exactly 1 or 2 times, select *Count Equals* and enter `1,2`.

## Sorting
- Click column headers to sort by *Count*, *Tag*, *Length*, *Action*, or *New Tag*.
- The Tag column cycles through: *Name*, *Name (reverse)*, *Length*, *Length (reverse)*.

## Context Menu & Quick Actions
- Right-click selected tags for quick actions: **Edit**, **Delete**, **Copy**, **Quick Actions** (transformations), selection tools, and **Revert changes**.
- Quick Actions include: convert case, replace spaces/underscores, add or remove escape characters, strip punctuation or digits, and other text transforms.

## Selection Hotkeys
- **Ctrl+A**: Select All
- **Ctrl+I**: Invert Selection
- **Esc**: Clear Selection
- **Ctrl+C**: Copy selected tags

## Pending Changes
- Pending edits are highlighted *green*; deletes are *red*.
- Filtering is disabled while pending changes exist.
- Use **Revert Selection** or **Refresh** to discard pending changes.

## Other Features

# Batch Upscale Help

## Supported File types
*.png, .webp, .jpg, .jpeg, .jpg_large, .jfif, .tif, .tiff, .bmp, .gif*

## Upscale Models
- *realesr-animevideov3-x4*
- *RealESRGAN_General_x4_v3*
- *realesrgan-x4plus*
- *realesrgan-x4plus-anime*
- *AnimeSharp-4x*
- *UltraSharp-4x*
- *Any additional "ESRGAN x4" models found in the `ncnn_models` directory will be added automatically.*

## Upscale Strength
Adjusts the blend between the original and upscaled images:
- *0%* â€” returns the original image.
- *100%* â€” applies the full upscaling effect.

## Processing Modes

### Single Mode
1. Select an image using the *Browse...* button or from the file list.
2. Adjust *Upscale Model*, *Upscale Factor*, and *Upscale Strength*.
3. Click **Upscale** to process the image.

### Batch Mode
1. Enable *Batch Mode*.
2. Select an input directory containing the images to upscale.
3. Click **Upscale** to process all supported images.
4. Click **Cancel** to stop processing at any time.

## Auto Output Naming
When enabled, output filenames and directories are generated automatically relative to the input path.

## Additional Note
- The tool performs an initial *4x* upscaling before applying the selected resize factor.
- Adjusting the upscale factor controls final size but does not change the internal 4x upscale step's behavior.

## Tips & Recommendations
- Add your own Real-ESRGAN NCNN models (.bin and .param) to *models/ncnn_models*.
- Use lower upscale factors for faster processing; use higher factors when larger outputs are required.

#region Batch Resize Images


BATCH_RESIZE_IMAGES_HELP = """
# Batch Resize Help

## Supported File types
- *.jpg*, *.jpeg*, *.png*, *.webp*, *.bmp*, *.tif*, *.tiff*

## Overview
A tool to resize or convert many images at once. Choose a resize method, set output options, then run the operation.

## Resize Modes
- **Resize to Resolution**
    - Resize to a specific width and height. *This ignores aspect ratio.*
- **Resize to Percentage**
    - Scale the image by a percent value (e.g., 50% = half size).
- **Resize to Width**
    - Target a specific width; height is adjusted to preserve aspect ratio.
- **Resize to Height**
    - Target a specific height; width is adjusted to preserve aspect ratio.
- **Resize to Shorter Side**
    - Resize so the shorter side matches the target while preserving aspect ratio.
- **Resize to Longer Side**
    - Resize so the longer side matches the target while preserving aspect ratio.

## Scaling Rules
- **Upscale and Downscale** - Apply the resize regardless of whether the result is larger or smaller than the original.
- **Upscale Only** - Resize only if the new dimensions are larger than the original.
- **Downscale Only** - Resize only if the new dimensions are smaller than the original.

## Quality & Output Format
- **Quality** - Controls output quality for *JPG* and *WEBP*. Higher values produce higher quality output. *Ignored for PNG.*
- **File type** - Choose *AUTO* to keep the input file type, or select a specific format to force all outputs to that type.

## Output Location & Overwrite
- **Use Output Folder** - When enabled, a folder named *Resize Output* is created inside the source folder and resized images are saved there.
- **Overwrite Files** - If disabled, conflicting filenames receive a unique suffix (e.g., _1). If enabled, existing files with the same basename are overwritten.

## PNG Metadata
- **Save PNG Info** - If saving as PNG, preserved PNG chunk info is written to the output. If converting from PNG to another format, a text file containing PNG chunk info is created alongside the converted file.

## Convert Only
- **Convert Only** - When enabled, images are converted to the chosen file type without changing dimensions. Resize settings are ignored.

## Tips
- Test with a small set of images to verify settings before processing large folders.
- Use *AUTO* file type to preserve original formats when you only need resizing.
- Be cautious with *Overwrite Files* as there is no automatic undo.
