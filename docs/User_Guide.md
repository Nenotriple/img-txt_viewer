Via the `Tools Menu`.

This stand-alone tool allows you to resize all images in a folder using various methods and conditions.

Supported Filetypes: `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `webp`, `bmp`, `tif`, `tiff`

- Resize To:
  - *Resize to Resolution*: Resize to a specific width and height, ignoring aspect ratio.

  - *Resize to Height*: Target the image height and resize it.
  - *Resize to Shorter Side*: Resize the shorter side of the image.
  - *Resize to Longer Side*: Resize the longer side of the image.

- Resize Condition:
  - *Upscale and Downscale*: Resize the image to the new dimensions, regardless of whether they're larger or smaller than the original dimensions.
  - *Upscale Only*: Resize the image if the new dimensions are larger than the original dimensions.
  - *Downscale Only*: Resize the image if the new dimensions are smaller than the original dimensions.

- Filetype:
  - Select 'AUTO' to output with the same filetype as the input image.
  - Alternatively, choose a specific filetype (JPG, PNG, or WEBP) to force all images to be saved with the chosen type.
  - JPG and WEBP are always saved with the highest quality possible.

- Use Output Folder:
  - If enabled, a folder `Resize Output` will be created, and the resized images will output there.
  - If disabled, the resized images will output to the selected directory.

- Overwrite Files:
  - if enabled, images will be overwritten when a filename conflict occurs.
  - if disabled, conflicting files will have '_#' appended to the filename.

---

### Resize Image
#### *(Resize the current image by exact resolution or percentage)*

Via the `Tools Menu` or the `image right-click context menu`.

Resize the currently displayed image using an exact resolution or by a percent scale.

Lock the aspect ratio to easily edit the width or height values without squishing or stretching the image.

Unlock the aspect ratio to allow entering a value that squishes or stretches the image.

For JPG and WEBP, you can adjust the output quality from 10%, to 100%.

You can choose between the following resize methods: `Lanczos`, `Nearest`, `Bicubic`, `Hamming`, `Bilinear`, and `Box`. Lanczos is the recommended method.

As you adjust the various settings, you can see the new dimensions and image size update in real time.

---

### Batch Crop Images
#### *(Crop all images to a specified resolution)*

Via the `Tools Menu`.

Crop all images to a specified resolution.

---

### Crop Image

- Click anywhere outside the crop area to clear the rectangle.
- Double-Click to quickly create a 512x512, or 1024x1024 crop rectangle. (Automatic based on image size)

- Each crop will have `_crop##` appended to the filename.
  - Saving multiple crops of the same image will increment the filename like this: `_crop01`, `_crop02`, etc.

---

### Upscale Image

 The current size and new size are displayed in the UI after selecting an Upscale Factor.

---

### Find Duplicate Files
#### *(Identify and separate duplicate files)*

Via the `Tools Menu`.

This stand-alone tool allows you to find all duplicate files in a folder, or subfolder* and move them out for easy sorting.
It works by generating and comparing a hash value for each image. You can use either `MD5`, or `SHA-256`. MD5 is faster and generally shouldn't result in false positive detections *(99.9% of the time, it's fine)*. SHA-256 is slower but should be much more resistant to false positives.

- Duplicate files will be moved to a `_Duplicate__Files` folder within the scanned directory.
- Single or Both:
  - Single: Choosing this option will move *all but one* of the found duplicates to the `_Duplicate__Files` folder.
  - Both: Choosing this option will move *all* of the found duplicates to the `_Duplicate__Files` folder.
- Images or All Files:
  - Images: Choosing this option will only check image files for duplicate matches, ignoring other files.
  - All Files: Choosing this option will check all files for duplicate matches.
- Recursive*:
  - Enable this option to scan subfolders.
  - NOTE: This only compares files within the same subfolder, not across all scanned folders.
- Set Max Scan Size:
  - Use this option to limit the maximum size of scanned files, ignoring files that are larger. (Default=2048 MB)
- Set Filetypes to Scan:
  - Use this option to limit the scanned files to only those listed, ignoring everything else.

- **Undo**
  - Using undo will restore all moved images back to their original file paths.

---

### Expand
#### *(Expand images to square ratio for simple backgrounds)*

Via the `Tools Menu` or the `image right-click context menu`.

Expand the currently displayed image to a square resolution without cropping.

This tool works by expanding the shorter side to a square resolution divisible by 8 and stretching the pixels around the long side to fill the space.

- For example:
  - A portrait image would expand like this: input=`||`, output=`| |`
  - A portrait image would expand like this: input=`| |`, output=`||`

After expanding, a new image will be saved in the same format and directory as the original, with `_ex` appended to the filename.

This tool works great for images with solid or very smooth gradient backgrounds. It's not intended to be useful for images without simple backgrounds.

### Edit Image Panel
#### *(Adjust image properties like brightness, contrast, etc.)*

Adjust image properties like brightness, contrast, etc.
