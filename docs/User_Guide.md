### Find Duplicate Files
#### *(Identify and separate duplicate files)*

Via the `Tools` menu.

This stand-alone tool allows you to find all duplicate files in a folder, or subfolder* and move them out for easy sorting.
It works by generating and comparing a hash value for each image. You can use either `MD5`, or `SHA-256`. MD5 is faster and generally shouldn`t result in false positive detections *(99.9% of the time, it`s fine)*. SHA-256 is slower but should be much more resistant to false positives.

- Duplicate files will be moved to a `_Duplicate__Files` folder within the scanned directory.
- Single or Both:
  - Single: Choosing this option will move *all but one* of the found duplicates to the `_Duplicate__Files` folder.
  - Both: Choosing this option will move *all* of the found duplicates to the `_Duplicate__Files` folder.
- Images or All Files:
  - Images: Choosing this option will only check image files for duplicate matches, ignoring other files.
  - All Files: Choosing this option will check all files for duplicate matches.
- Recursive*:
  - Enable this option to scan subfolders.
  - NOTE: This only compares files within the same subfolder, not across all scanned folders.
- Set Max Scan Size:
  - Use this option to limit the maximum size of scanned files, ignoring files that are larger. (Default=2048 MB)
- Set Filetypes to Scan:
  - Use this option to limit the scanned files to only those listed, ignoring everything else.

- **Undo**
  - Using undo will restore all moved images back to their original file paths.

### Expand
#### *(Expand images to square ratio for simple backgrounds)*

Via the `Tools` menu or the `image right-click context menu`.

Expand the currently displayed image to a square resolution without cropping.

This tool works by expanding the shorter side to a square resolution divisible by 8 and stretching the pixels around the long side to fill the space.

- For example:
  - A portrait image would expand like this: input=`||`, output=`| |`
  - A portrait image would expand like this: input=`| |`, output=`||`

After expanding, a new image will be saved in the same format and directory as the original, with `_ex` appended to the filename.

This tool works great for images with solid or very smooth gradient backgrounds. It`s not intended to be useful for images without simple backgrounds.

### Batch Rename/Convert
#### *(Rename and convert files sequentially with padded zeros)*

Via the `Tools` menu.

This will rename and convert all images and text* files in the selected directory. **(Only rename text files)*

Files are saved to a `Renamed Output` folder, nothing is overwritten.

Images are converted to `JPG` type (except for `GIF` files), and then each img-txt pair is renamed in sequential order using padded zeros to ensure 5 characters.

Example input pair: `aH15520.jpg`, `AH15520.txt`

Example output pair: `00001.jpg`, `00001.txt`
