  <summary>Release Notes for v1.96</summary>


This release introduces several new features and improvements, including AutoTag for automatic image tagging using ONNX vision models (WD14), revamped Batch Tag Edit and Crop tools, a Thumbnail Panel for quick navigation, and an Edit Image Panel for adjusting image properties. Additionally, numerous bugs have been fixed, such as issues with the Delete Pair tool, image quality degradation, and memory leaks.

The app now targets Windows 11, providing a more modern look and feel for most widgets.

Starting from this release, the `Lite` version will no longer be provided. All tools are now built-in.


---


**New:**
- **AutoTag**: Automatically tag images using ONNX vision models like `wd-v1-4-vit-tagger-v2`.
  - Download additional models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/SmilingWolf).
  - Place models in subfolders within the `onnx_models` directory, located in the same folder as this program. The subfolder name will be used as the model name.
  - Each model subfolder should contain a `model.onnx` file and a `selected_tags.csv` file.
  - Auto-Tagging was primarily tested with the `wd-v1-4-moat-tagger-v2` model.
- **Batch Tag Edit**: Previously known as Batch Tag Delete, this tool has been completely reworked for more versatile tag editing.
  - The interface is now more convenient and user-friendly, allowing you to see all pending changes before committing them.
  - It is no longer supported as a standalone tool.
- **Batch Resize Images**: Integrated into the main app.
  - NEW: A timer is now displayed in the bottom row.
  - FIXED: The following resize modes not working/causing an error: `Longer Side`, and `Height`.
  - FIXED: The resize operation is now threaded, allowing the app to remain responsive during the resizing process.
- **Find Duplicate Files**:
  - Integrated into the main app.
  - New Feature: Added "Move Captions" option.
    - Moves text pairs when found. Only works in "Images" scanning mode.
- **Crop Tool**: Completely reworked with new features and improved usability.
  - Includes all standard cropping features.
  - Special `Auto` fixed aspect ratio mode for quick cropping based on the image's aspect ratio and predefined aspect ratios.
- **Thumbnail Panel**: Displayed below the current image for quick navigation.
- **Edit Image Panel**: Enabled from the options/image menu, this section allows you to edit the `Brightness`, `Contrast`, `Saturation`, `Sharpness`, `Highlights`, and `Shadows` of the current image.
- **Edit Image**: Open the current image in an external editor, with MS Paint as the default.
  - Running `Set Default Image Editor` will open a dialog to select the executable (or `.py`, `.pyw`) path to use as the default image editor.
  - This should work with any app that accepts a file path as a launch argument (e.g., GIMP, Krita, Photoshop).
- **Create Wildcard From Captions**: Combine all image captions into a single text file, each set of image captions separated by a newline.
- **Copy Command**: Added to the right-click textbox context menu.
- **Last Command**: Added to the index entry right-click context menu to quickly jump to the last img-txt pair.
- **Additional Upscale Models**: Added `AnimeSharp-4x` and `UltraSharp-4x`.
- **NCNN Upscale Models**: Additional models can now be loaded by placing them in the `models` directory.
- **Insert Suggestion**: Now you can insert a suggestion by simply clicking it.
- **Guided Setup**: A quick guided setup will run on the app's first launch, or if the settings file is deleted/reset.
  - This will set the preferred autocomplete dictionaries and matching settings.
- **Close Window Shortcut**: Press `CTRL+W` to close the current window.
- **Danbooru (Safe)**: Added to the list of available dictionaries, a great choice to load with the English dictionary.
- **Easter Egg Game**: Can be opened from the ImgTxtViewer About Window.


**Fixed:**
- Fixed issue where the `Delete Pair` tool would overwrite the next index with the deleted text. #31
- Fixed an issue that was degrading the quality of the displayed image and not respecting the `Image Display Quality` setting.
- Fixed a memory leak that could occur whenever the primary image is displayed.
- Fixed Next/Previous button not properly displaying their relief when clicked.
- Fixed an issue where landscape images were improperly scaled, leading to an incorrect aspect ratio.
  - Additionally, large landscape images now scale to fit the window frame better.
- Fixed `Open Text Directory...` not respecting the actual filepath if set by `Set Text File Path...`.
- Fixed issue where the file lists were not updated when using the internal function `jump_to_image()`.
- Fixed an issue where the `alt text path` could be set to `.` when declining to reload the last directory.
- Fixed a bug where the window height would enlarge slightly when dragging the window from by the displayed image.
- Fixed the following tools not respecting the `Loading Order > Descending` setting, causing them to jump to the wrong index:
  - `Image Grid`, `Upscale Image`, `Resize Image`.
- Potential fix for the `Stats > PPI` calculation returning "0.00".
- If `clean-text` is enabled: The primary text box is now properly refreshed when saving.
- Fixed an issue when deleting tags that are a substring of another tag using middle-mouse-click. #38
- Fixed an issue where the system clipboard would become unresponsive after deleting a tag with the middle mouse button. #38
- Fixed an issue where settings were not restored when choosing to not reload the last directory.
- Fixed an error when loading the app and `my_tags.csv` didn't exist.
- Fixed an issue where suggestions weren't generated from `my_tags.csv` if no primary dictionary was loaded.
- Reloading the last directory is a little faster / smoother now.


**Other Changes:**
- Autocomplete suggestions are now cached, so re-typing the same words returns suggestions quicker.
  - Some pre-caching is done for Autocomplete suggestions, which does slow down the initial launch slightly.
- Using `Open Current Directory...` will now automatically select the current image in the file explorer. #30
  - The `Open` button will also select the current image if the path being opened is the same as the image path.

  <summary>Release Notes for v1.90</summary>


I'm very happy to announce **img-txt_viewer is 1 year old!** üéâüéà

I love knowing this app has helped at least a few people work faster and easier, and I want to thank everyone so much for your interest and support.

Here's some new tools, fixes, and changes for version 1.90:


---


- New:
  - `Find Duplicate Files`: Quickly find and separate duplicate images in your dataset.
    - This works by checking file hash - 2GB file limit. Can be used for all files
    - Built as a stand alone tool.
  - `Rename/convert img-txt Pairs`: Easily rename and convert your dataset in a clean format.
    - All images are converted to ".jpg" format to prevent duplicate filename issues.
    - JPG conversion quality is set to 100, this ensures a small file size and no visible compression will be added for most conversions.
    - Example: 00001.jpg, 00001.txt.
  - `Expand Current Image`: Expand images to a square resolution without cropping.
    - This tool makes an image square by extending its shorter side to match the length of its longer side, after rounding that length down to the nearest multiple of 8.
    - The empty space is then filled by expanding the border of pixels from the long side.
  - `Crop Image`: Crop the currently displayed image.
    - Currently only supports cropping by square (1:1) or freeform.
    - Double click to quickly create a 512x512 or 1024x1024 rectangle (automatically decided based on image size)
    - Right-click the image to open the context menu and select either Crop, Clear, or Open Directory.
    - Mousewheel to resize the rectangle.
  - `Flip Image`: Flip the currently displayed image horizontally.
  - `Rotate Image`: Rotate the the currently displayed image 90 degrees.
  - `Duplicate Pair`: Duplicate the currently displayed img-txt pair.
  - `Filter Pairs` Changes:
    - New option to display only empty text files.
    - Use `!` before the text to exclude any pairs containing that text.
    - Use `+` between text to include multiple strings when filtering.
    - Example: `!dog + cat` (remove dog pairs, display cat pairs)
  - `Resize Images` v1.01 Changes:
    - You can now choose image filetype for the resized output.
    - You can now set the `Resize Condition` to the following modes:
      - `Upscale and Downscale`, Resize the image to the new dimensions regardless of whether they are larger or smaller than the original dimensions.
      - `Upscale Only`, Resize the image if the new dimensions are larger than the original dimensions.
      - `Downscale Only`, Resize the image if the new dimensions are smaller than the original dimensions
  - `Batch Tag Delete` v1.07 Changes:
    - Significantly improved the speed tags are deleted.

<details>
  <summary>Release Notes for v1.82</summary>


The biggest visible change this release is the addition of a new Paned Window that now holds all text tools. (excluding Batch Tag Delete)
This makes it way more simple and easier to use these tools.

  - Basically all text tools were completely redone.

  - New option: `Suggestion Style` Here you can select from four options. The old style is still there, plus a new default style.
