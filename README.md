# üìù Usage


> [!NOTE]
>
> Prepare Your Files:
>
> - If you choose to include a text pair for an image, ensure they share the same basename.
>   - For example: `01.png, 01.txt`, `02.jpg, 02.txt`, etc.
>
> Supported image formats: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.jfif`, `.jpg_large`, `.webp`, `.bmp`, `.gif`.


Images and text files can be loaded from different folder paths. Expand the section below to learn more.


<details>


  <summary>Selecting an alternate text path...</summary>


---


By default, text files are loaded from the selected directory. To load text files from a different path:

1. Select a directory as usual.
2. Right-click the `Browse...` button and choose `Set Text File Path`.
3. When an alternate path is chosen, a blue indicator appears to the left of the directory entry. Hover over the indicator to view the selected text path.

Example folder structures:
```
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dataset/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01.png
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01.txt
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02.jpg
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 02.txt
```
*(Images and text files in same folder)*

```
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dataset/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01.png
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 02.jpg
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ captions/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01.txt
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 02.txt
