# üìù Usage

> [!NOTE]
> - Prepare Your Files:
>    - If you choose to include a text pair for an image, ensure they share the same basename.
>      - For example: `01.png, 01.txt`, `02.jpg, 02.txt`, etc.
>  - Supported image types: `.png` `.jpg` `.jpeg` `.jfif` `.jpg_large` `.webp` `.bmp` `.gif`


Images and text files can be loaded from different folder paths. Expand the section below to learn more.

<details>
  <summary>Selecting an alternate text path...</summary>

By default, text files are loaded from the chosen path. To load text files from a different path, first select a directory as usual, then right-click the `Browse...` button and select `Set Text File Path`. An indicator to the left of the Directory entry will turn blue when a different path is chosen, and hovering the mouse over the indicator will display the selected text path.

 - Example folder structures:


```
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dataset/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01.png
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01.txt
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02.jpg
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 02.txt
```
*(Images and text files in same folder)*

```
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dataset/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01.png
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 02.jpg
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ captions/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01.txt
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 02.txt
```
*(Images and text files in separate folder)*
